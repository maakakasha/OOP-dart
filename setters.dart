// Setter is used to set the value of a property. 
//It is mostly used to update a private propertyâ€™s value. 
//Setter provide explicit write access to an object properties.
// Might be useful in the case of writing data into providers
// This allows writing, which is not allowed when it comes to static access.

// Getter and setters in dart getter are class-built-in methods in classes 
//the getter, that is returns A datatype when it is being called by its instance
// The getter can utilize the local variables defined within the class without using static access
